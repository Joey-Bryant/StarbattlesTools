## Running Locally

Follow these instructions if you want to run both the backend server and the frontend on your own machine. This is ideal for development or offline use.

### 1. Backend Server Setup
First, ensure you have Python 3 installed.
**Navigate to the `localWebApp/` directory.** All subsequent commands should be run from here.
Create and activate a virtual environment (highly recommended):
```bash
# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
py -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the project in "editable" mode. This command reads the `pyproject.toml` file, installs all dependencies, and correctly configures the Python path.
```bash
pip install -e .
```
*(The `.` refers to the current directory, `localWebApp/`)*

### 2. Run the Backend Server

With your virtual environment still active, run the server:
```bash
python run.py
```
The backend will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5001`. Keep this terminal window open.

### 3. Run the Frontend Application

With the backend server running, simply open the `localWebApp/index.html` file in your web browser. The application is already configured to connect to your local backend and will be fully functional.

> **Note:** The `LiveDemo` and `localWebApp` versions are identical except for the `API_BASE_URL` variable in `script.js`, which is pre-set in each version to point to the correct backend (live vs. local).

## Miscellaneous Tools

This repository also includes a `MiscTools/` folder. This directory contains a collection of various scripts and utilities that are not part of the core puzzle application but may be useful for advanced users or for performing other interesting tasks. Feel free to explore them if you're curious.
